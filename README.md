# Serverless Application with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, SQS, and DynamoDB

This project demonstrates how to build a fully **Serverless Application** using AWS services like **Lambda**, **API Gateway**, **S3**, **SQS**, and **DynamoDB**. The architecture ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and low operational overhead by eliminating the need for managing servers.

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a serverless application that processes requests via **API Gateway**, triggers background processing with **AWS Lambda**, stores data in **DynamoDB**, and handles message queuing with **SQS**. This architecture provides a highly scalable and cost-effective solution for handling various workloads.

You can view the project details [here](https://awsportfolio.sila.studio/project/serverless-application/).

This project was completed as part of the **Digital Cloud Training** bootcamp, where I learned how to design and implement serverless applications using AWS services.

### Key Features
- **API Gateway**: Used to expose RESTful APIs that trigger Lambda functions for business logic execution.
- **AWS Lambda**: Handles the backend processing without the need to provision or manage servers.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores static files and handles file uploads via Lambda.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Provides a highly available and scalable NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Amazon SQS**: Manages message queues for asynchronous background processing, enabling reliable task execution.

## Architecture

The architecture includes:
1. **Amazon API Gateway**: Acts as the entry point for clients, invoking AWS Lambda functions based on HTTP requests.
2. **AWS Lambda**: Executes business logic in response to events from API Gateway and S3.
3. **Amazon S3**: Stores static content and serves as a trigger for file processing workflows.
4. **Amazon DynamoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store structured application data with low-latency access.
5. **Amazon SQS**: Handles message queuing, ensuring asynchronous task processing and decoupling Lambda functions.

## AWS Services Used
- **Amazon API Gateway**: For exposing RESTful APIs and routing client requests to Lambda functions.
- **AWS Lambda**: Provides serverless compute for handling backend business logic.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores static assets and uploads triggered by Lambda.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Manages scalable NoSQL data storage with low-latency access.
- **Amazon SQS**: Provides reliable message queuing for background task management.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors application performance and logs.

## How to Deploy
1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Deploy the architecture using the CloudFormation template provided.
3. Set up **API Gateway** to invoke Lambda functions in response to client requests.
4. Configure **S3** for static content and Lambda triggers for file uploads.
5. Test the application by making requests through API Gateway and observing the processing flow.

## Lessons Learned
- **Serverless Architecture**: Leveraging AWS services like Lambda and API Gateway eliminates the need for infrastructure management while providing a scalable solution.
- **Decoupling with SQS**: Using SQS for message queuing helps manage tasks asynchronously, making the architecture more resilient.
- **DynamoDB for Scalability**: DynamoDBâ€™s auto-scaling capabilities ensure that the database can handle any level of traffic without manual intervention.

## Next Steps
- Integrate **AWS Cognito** for user authentication and authorization.
- Implement **AWS Step Functions** to orchestrate complex workflows.
- Add **AWS CloudFront** for global content delivery and caching static assets stored in S3.
